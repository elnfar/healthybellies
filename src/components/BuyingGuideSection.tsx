            The Expert’s Guide to Choosing a GLP-1 Patch That Actually Works
          </h2>


          {/* Effective Hormone Support */}

    <span className="text-green-500 mr-3 text-lg font-bold bg-green-500 rounded-full p-2 h-6 w-6 flex items-center justify-center text-white">✓</span>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Consistent, Effective Hormone Support</h3>
  </div>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    The mark of a truly effective GLP-1 patch is steady, day-long hormonal support — not quick bursts followed by crashes. 
    A legitimate patch should deliver ingredients consistently through advanced transdermal technology, maintaining appetite control and stable energy for 8–12 hours straight. 
    When that balance is achieved, you’ll feel it — fewer cravings, smoother moods, and real metabolic stability.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    If your patch fades after just a few hours, it’s not real GLP-1 support — it’s simply a sticker with marketing behind it.

{/* Medical-Grade Ingredients */}

  <div className="flex items-center mb-4">
    <span className="text-green-500 mr-3 text-lg font-bold bg-green-500 rounded-full p-2 h-6 w-6 flex items-center justify-center text-white">✓</span>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Clinically Backed, Medical-Grade Ingredients</h3>
  </div>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Potency matters. The best GLP-1 patches use clinically supported doses of proven compounds — not trace amounts that look impressive on a label but do nothing for your body. 
    A properly formulated patch doesn’t just dull hunger; it nourishes your metabolism, supports insulin sensitivity, and promotes balanced hormone function from within.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    Always choose brands that disclose their full ingredient list and use medical-grade formulations — transparency and quality go hand in hand.

{/* Hypoallergenic Adhesive */}
<div className="mb-8">
  <div className="flex items-center mb-4">
    <span className="text-green-500 mr-3 text-lg font-bold bg-green-500 rounded-full p-2 h-6 w-6 flex items-center justify-center text-white">✓</span>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Skin-Safe, Hypoallergenic Adhesive</h3>
  </div>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Your skin deserves the same level of care as your hormones. 
    Premium patches use hypoallergenic, medical-grade adhesives that stay secure all day without causing redness or irritation — even on sensitive, perimenopausal skin. 
    This ensures the ingredients absorb effectively while keeping your skin calm, comfortable, and healthy.
  </p>

{/* Waterproof Construction */}
<div className="mb-8">
  <div className="flex items-center mb-4">
    <span className="text-green-500 mr-3 text-lg font-bold bg-green-500 rounded-full p-2 h-6 w-6 flex items-center justify-center text-white">✓</span>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Durable, Waterproof Construction</h3>
  </div>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    A high-quality GLP-1 patch should fit your life — not the other way around. 
    Look for waterproof construction that withstands showers, workouts, and even hot flashes without peeling or losing effectiveness. 
    Reliable adherence isn’t just convenient; it’s critical for uninterrupted nutrient delivery and steady hormonal balance throughout the day.

{/* Ethical Manufacturing */}

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Ethical Manufacturing & Transparency</h3>
  </div>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Trust begins with transparency. 
    Always choose brands that follow ethical, third-party-verified manufacturing standards and disclose every active ingredient. 
    You deserve to know exactly what you’re putting on your skin — and that it’s been tested for safety, potency, and purity. 
    When those standards are met, results are not only visible but consistent week after week.
