            Warning Signs of Ineffective GLP-1 Patches (and How to Avoid Getting Scammed)

  </div>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    After testing countless GLP-1 patches, one thing became crystal clear — the biggest deal-breaker is how the ingredients are delivered. 
    Many patches claim “24-hour support,” but the reality is that the formula fades within hours, leaving you hungry, tired, and disappointed.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    The transdermal system is everything. If it isn’t engineered to release nutrients evenly, you’ll never experience the stable appetite control and energy lift you deserve.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    The sweet spot? A medical-grade system designed for slow, consistent absorption over 8–12 hours. 
    When it’s done right, cravings stay quiet, energy stays smooth, and your metabolism feels like it’s finally working with you again.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    If you’re hungry again by midday, that’s your sign — it’s time to upgrade to a real GLP-1 patch.

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">No Backing From Women’s Health Experts</h3>
  </div>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Far too many brands jump into the GLP-1 trend without input from endocrinologists or women’s health specialists. 
    They throw together basic formulas, slap “hormone balance” on the label, and hope for the best.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    A truly effective patch must be designed with women’s hormonal physiology in mind — especially for those in perimenopause or post-menopause. 
    This ensures it supports natural GLP-1 function without disrupting other vital hormones.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    When formulations are guided by real clinical expertise, you’ll notice smoother energy, fewer cravings, and better emotional balance — the difference is night and day.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Always check that the brand collaborates with qualified health professionals — it’s the easiest way to separate serious science from marketing noise.

{/* Substandard Adhesive Quality */}

    <span className="text-red-500 mr-3 text-lg font-bold bg-red-500 rounded-full p-2 h-6 w-6 flex items-center justify-center text-white">✗</span>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Poor Adhesive Quality</h3>
  </div>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    The adhesive might not seem important — until it starts peeling mid-day. 
    Many low-cost patches use cheap glue that breaks down under heat, sweat, or movement, which completely disrupts ingredient delivery.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    High-end GLP-1 patches use medical-grade, hypoallergenic adhesives that stay put through showers, workouts, and long days. 
    They adhere comfortably without irritation, ensuring consistent absorption and uninterrupted support.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    If your patch slides off before bedtime, you’re not just losing stick — you’re losing results. 
    The right adhesive makes all the difference between frustration and true, steady progress.
